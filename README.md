# Project 2

Your Arduino project must include the following:

* Sensor input (e.g. light, sound, distance)
* Motion output (stepper and servo motors). You may have two circuits to use different motors.

**Clarification:**  
You may have one sensor to trigger both motors. You may have both motors connected together or separately.
