# Image On Request

Ah, the age old pastime of looking things up. What a treat to have entire catalogues of knowledge at your fingertips! What joy can be found. But aren't you tired of having to type things into a search engine when you want to see something? And aren't there just *too* many images out there? And what's with these high resolution screens revealing every minute detail? Who's got the time or energy to even process all of that! There's got to be a better way!

No, friend, what you need is a simple solution. Something that harkens back to the frontier days, when life was tougher, but more rewarding. You need a time capsule back to the past, but with only specific modern conveniences. You need **Image On Request**â„¢.

## But How Does It Work?

Why friend, it's simple! By simply talking into the microphone, you can request any image from our carefully curated library of preselected images, designed to cover all the bases. Simply say "Hey Google, Draw  _____" and it will output it onto the conveniently attached screen. 

If you don't know what you want to draw, you can say, "Hey Google, Draw a random image" and Google will select an image for you to display on the OLED screen. 

If you would like to know all that Google can draw, say, "Hey Google, what can you draw?" and Google will tell you the different categories of images it can draw from.

With this kind of technology we were able to display an astounding 20 different images, with even more options potentially becoming available in the next few decades!
