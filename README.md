# Project #1

Your project must include the following:

1. Sensor #1 input (e.g. light, sound, distance etc.)
2. Sensor #2 input (e.g. temperature, flame, humidity etc.)
3. Serial monitor output (part of the Arduino IDE)
4. Light or sound output (use an LED or a buzzer)
5. LCD or OLED output (may use I2C)

**Clarification**

You don't have to connect two sensors simultaneously or produce all three outputs at the same time. Mix and match inputs and outputs as you wish, as long as you use all 5 of them.
You may use a button or a joystick instead of one of the sensors.
You may (should?) use two design boards and switch between them between presentations.
Look at [Arduino lessons 5-12](https://learn.adafruit.com/series/learn-arduino) for inspiration.
Present your project in class on Friday and submit your code to the branch project1.
